 <p>A homage to `90s User interface design, combined with modern development. Arial is centered around creating an operating system that is simple, beautiful and accessible.</p>

 <h2>About the Project</h2>
 <p>The initial idea of developing an operating system was spared by my boredom in my computer science class during high school. Spurred by that boredom and the abundance of free time brought by lockdown I started to experiment with some of the example code and tutorials on the <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page">osdev wiki</a>. This experimentation eventually formed the base of Arial in late 2021 and I formally started the project in march that following year with on-and-off-again development as I finished secondary school.</p>
